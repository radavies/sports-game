Hello boss, welcome to {}!

We've been on a good run of late getting the team established in the {}, but there's still a lot of work to do here.

As the new owner we hope you'll take good care of the club and lead us to trophies and glory 🏆

You'll be responsible for the overall management of the club from finances 📈 to staffing 🗣️ and constructing new facilities 🚧

The better the club does competitively the more prize money 💰 and reputation 💪 we'll gain, so it's important you get the team performing.

While your initial cash injection will be helpful in the short term, our reputation will be critical in bring lucrative sponsors onboard to keep us going longer term 💸

Good luck 👍
