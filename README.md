Silly Sports Sim Game

### What is the game?

* What is your role?
  * Owner - you can buy upgrades, players, managers etc but the sim is stat based
  
### What UI do we need?

* Story / intro page 
  * Explain the game
  * Use the team name / city etc 
  * "Welcome to your club boss"

* Dashboard
  * Where the game is played from - opens up other UIs as required
  * Player overview
  * Club overview (finances, upgrades etc)
  * Calendar (upcoming events)
  * League table
  * "Inbox"
  * Advance time 

* Save / Load


### ToDo
* Generate fixtures
* Save / load data structures etc

### Ideas

* board expectations?
* Add managers
* Add European Teams
* Add Rest of World Teams
* Injuries / sickness
* Team modifiers - fired up, on a run, on a bad run etc
* Should the game run on a proper calendar? (if so need to refactor the ages to be DoBs)
