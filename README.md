Silly Sports Sim Game

### ToDo
* Give players stats when they're generated

### Ideas

* Add European Teams
* Add Rest of World Teams
* Injuries / sickness
* Team modifiers - fired up, on a run, on a bad run etc
* Managers
* Should the game run on a proper calendar? (if so need to refactor the ages to be DoBs)
